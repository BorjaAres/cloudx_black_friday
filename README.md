**Summary: CloudX's Black Friday Sale Program**

The program precisely adheres to CloudX's Black Friday criteria with two essential methods. The apply_discount method is refined through unit testing, split into three focused sections. Testing also guides check_valid_input creation, evaluating data types and values to ensure a solid performance.

The program features two classes: Client for log-in/sign-up and Cart for cart management. Each Client() instance is seamlessly integrated with a Cart() instance, offering personalized carts.

The result: a terminal-based CloudX simulation encompassing sign-up, log-in, product browsing, cart management, and Black Friday discounts. This solution aligns closely with CloudX's request.
